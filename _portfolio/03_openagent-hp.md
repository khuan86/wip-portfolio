> **Tools:** Photoshop, Illustrator  

**tl;dr:** New design has a stronger brand identity that looks welcoming, trustworthy and professional.

Problem
------------
As a new start-up, the client went through several stages of design. Design was last on the list and the website was mainly there to serve a purpose: lead generation. They were growing rapidly and realised they needed a stronger brand identity.

I agreed with them that the old design looked too busy and lacked a lot of personality. It also looked quite outdated and therefore unprofessional.

Solution
------------
#### UX
I worked with their UX Designer to complete the redesign. They already had wireframes for the project and were quite happy with the hierarchy, but I made a few suggestions for some sections be moved around. I felt that the "as seen as" logos should be moved up closer to the search field as they are a new company that has not established trust yet. Including well known logos such as The Business Insider and Yahoo7! helps solidify their presence within market, thereby increasing the level of trust between the brand and the user.

The end goal for the homepage was to do as many A/B variation testing so a lot of the sections and wording could be moved around. The redesign was a good starting point for it.

#### Design
The client mostly wanted a more modern look and feel of the website so I kept most of the established branding as possible from the supplied offline marketing material (fonts, hero image, green colour). I honestly felt that the old design was almost there, it just needed to be cleaned up and polished, so-to-speak.

Icons should be supportive to the text and the old design was too "heavy" and distracting, achieving the opposite effect. So I created new icons to be more in line with the rest of the redesign, keeping it light, fun and modern. The result is easy on the eyes and fully supportive to the copy. I supplied the developers with `.svg` versions of the icons to ensure scale-ability when viewed at any resolution and dpi/ppi.

The client did not want to include the "As seen on" video but still wanted to keep the testimonials. To keep the design as clutter-free as possible, I turned the videos into a non-auto-moving carousal with a quoted text that I felt was engaging and easy/quick to read at a glance.
